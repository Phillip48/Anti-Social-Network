## Description  
MongoDB is a popular choice for many social networks due to its speed with large amounts of data and flexibility with unstructured data. With this project the goal was to create a social API using monogoose and mongoDB. In this API users can share their thoughts, react to friends’ thoughts, and create a friend list.

## The Project
```md
AS A social media startup
I WANT an API for my social network that uses a NoSQL database
SO THAT my website can handle large amounts of unstructured data
```

- [x] When the server is started and the Mongoose models are synced to the MongoDB database  
- [x] When open i API GET routes in Insomnia for users and thoughts then the data for each of these routes is displayed in a formatted JSON  
- [x] When I do an API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia then I am able to successfully create, update, and delete users and thoughts in my database  
- [x] When I do an API POST and DELETE routes in Insomnia then I am able to successfully create and delete reactions to thoughts and add and remove friends to a user’s list

## The development process

In order to accomplish the challenge, the following steps were done:  

* I brainstormed where to start and how to go about it.
* Used the models in the Readme
* Used the mongoose docs and class examples
* Followed the acceptance criteria
* Used insomnia
